8. Long Parallelism, pairwise conflicting resources
9. Long Parallelism, Staggered resources
10. Long Parallelism, varying durations, semi-conflicting resources (staggered but time overlap)
11. Long Parallelism, same as (8) but short time (not enough time)
12. Long Parallelism, same as (9) but short time (should be perfect amount)

13. Simple loop
14. Long loop (multiple tasks, closely packed time)

15. Large branching of two parallelisms
16. Large parallelsim of two branchings

17. "validate customer" - from Camunda examples

24. Priorities 1 - all same priority
25. Priorities 1 - low and high parallel
26. Priorities 1 - low offsets high due to timing
